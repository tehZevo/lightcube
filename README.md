# Lightcube

A spiking neural network using [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js).  
~~This totally isn't an excuse to fiddle around / brush up on my TFJS..~~

## TODO
* Server/client communication between lightcubes
  * API to add potential to / manually spike neurons
  * API to reward neurons (Hebbian/R-STDP learning)
  * Connecting lightcubes to each other in a virtual 3d space
* Web UI for visualizing lightcube
